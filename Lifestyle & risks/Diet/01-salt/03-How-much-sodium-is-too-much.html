            <p>Remember that less is better, particularly if you are sodium sensitive. Consult a dietician or your doctor if you are unsure of the recommended intake of salt in your diet.</p>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">FOR ADULTS</b>
                    <p>Adults should consume no more than 6g (or around 1 teaspoon) of salt (2.4g sodium) per day.</p>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">FOR CHILDREN</b>
                    <p>Children aged:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 to 3 years should consume no more than 2g salt a day (0.8g sodium)</li>
                            <li>4 to 6 years should consume no more than 3g salt a day (1.2g sodium)</li>
                            <li>7 to 10 years should consume no more than 5g salt a day (2g sodium)</li>
                            <li>11 years and over should consume no more than 6g salt a day (2.4g sodium)</li>
                        </ul>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">FOR BABIES</b>
                    <p>Babies should not consume much salt, because their kidneys are not fully developed to process it.</p>
                    <p>Babies under 1 year old should have less than 1g of salt a day.</p>
                    <p>Breast milk contains the proper amount of nutrients, including salt, for nursing infants. The mineral content of formula milk is comparable to that of breast milk.</p>
                    <p>You shouldn't salt your baby's milk or food, and you shouldn't feed your infant meals with stock cubes or gravy because these are frequently heavy in salt and your baby's kidneys can't handle them.</p>
                    <p>If you intend to feed your kid the same food as the rest of the family, keep this in mind when you're preparing meals.</p>
                    <p>Avoid offering your baby salty foods, which are frequently high in salt, such bacon, sausages, crackers, crisps, prepared meals, or takeout.</p>
                    <p>Food manufactured specifically for babies should meet the recommended levels. If in doubt, always check food labels.</p>
