        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <p>The supermarket is full of foods labelled with reduced sodium or light in sodium. However, DO NOT ASSUME that means they are low in sodium. For instance, a can of chicken noodle soup with a 25% salt reduction claim nevertheless has a whopping 524 mg of sodium per cup. Only ordinary chicken noodle soup, which contains more than 790 mg of sodium per cup, is lower in salt than this dish.</p>
            <p>Hereâ€™s a rundown on common sodium claims and what they really mean:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: '-> ';">
                    <li><b>Sodium-free or salt-free.</b>Each serving in this product contains less than 5 mg of sodium</li>
                    <li><b>Very low sodium.</b>Each serving contains 35 mg of sodium or less</li>
                    <li><b>Low sodium.</b>Each serving contains 140 mg of sodium or less</li>
                    <li><b>Reduced or less sodium.</b>The product contains at least 25% less sodium than the regular version</li>
                    <li><b>Lite or light in sodium.</b>The sodium content has been decreased by at least 50% from the regular version.</li>
                    <li><b>Unsalted or no salt added.</b>No salt is added during processing of a food that normally contains salt. However, some of the foods with these labels may still be high in sodium because some of the ingredients may be high in sodium.</li>
