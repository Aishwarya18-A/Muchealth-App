                    <p>It's important to keep in mind that effervescent medicines and vitamin supplements, which dissolve in the mouth, can contain up to 1g of salt per tablet if taken regularly. Therefore, you might want to think about switching to a non-effervescent tablet, especially if you have been told to watch or lower your salt intake. Before changing the medication, you take, see a doctor or pharmacist.</p>
