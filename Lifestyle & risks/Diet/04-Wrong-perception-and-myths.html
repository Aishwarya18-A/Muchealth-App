          <h5>WRONG PERCEPTION AND MYTHS ABOUT SALT REDUCTION</h5>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <ol>
                <li><b>"You need extra salt in your diet on a hot, muggy day because you sweat more"</b></li>
                    
                        Even on a hot and muggy day, there is no need for more salt because little salt is lost through sweat, however it is still vital to drink plenty of water.
                <li><b>"Just because something is 'natural,' it doesn't mean it's 'better,'"</b></li>
                    
                        No matter where the salt comes from, the sodium in salt is what has a negative impact on our health.</ul>
                <li><b>"Salt intake is not primarily derived from salt used during cooking." About 80% of the salt used daily in many nations comes from processed foods. “Food does not need salt to have appealing flavour.”</b></li>
                        
                        It takes some time for a person’s taste buds to adjust, but once they get used to less salt, one is more likely to enjoy food and notice a broader range of flavours.
                <li><b>"Food without salt has no flavour."</b></li> 
                        
                        While initially this may be true, your taste buds will quickly get used to less salt, increasing the likelihood that you will choose food with more flavour and less salt.
                <li><b>“Foods high in salt taste salty.”</b></li>
                    
                        Some foods that are high in salt don't taste very salty as sometimes they are mixed with other things like sugars that mask the taste. It is important to read food labels to find out sodium levels.
                <li><b>“Only old people need to worry about how much salt they eat:”</b></li>
                    
                        Eating too much salt can raise blood pressure at any age.
                <li><b>“Reducing salt could be bad for my health:”</b></li>
                    
                        It is very difficult to eat too little salt since there are so many everyday foods containing salt.
