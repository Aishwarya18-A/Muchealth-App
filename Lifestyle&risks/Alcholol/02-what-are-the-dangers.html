                           <p>The following are the short-term consequences of alcohol misuse:</p>
                        
                            <ul>
                                <li> Injuries and accidents which requires medical attention, such

                                    violence</li>
                                <li>Sexual activity without protection that may result in an
                                    unforeseen pregnancy or STDs (STIs)</li>
                                <li>loss of personal belongings like smartphones wallets,
                                    or keys</li>

                                    and unconsciousness</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Binge drinkers are more prone to act recklessly and run a higher
                                 risk of getting into accidents because they consume large amounts
                                 of alcohol over a short period of time.</p>

                            <p>Alcoholism raises your likelihood of developing major health
                                problems, such as:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Stroke</li>

                                    <li>Liver disease</li>
                                    <li>Bowel cancer </li>
                                    <li> Pancreatitis</li>
                                    <li> Heart disease</li>
                                    <li>Mouth cancer</li>

                                 </ul>
                            <p>In addition, long-term alcohol addiction can result in major health
                                issues as well as social issues for some people, including, divorce,
                                domestic violence, unemployment, and homelessness</p>
                            <p>Dependent drinking occurs when a person loses control of their
                                drinking and has an excessive desire to drink (alcoholism)</p>
                            <p>Although a person's relationships and quality of life are typically
                                impacted by dependent drinking, they may not always find it simple
                                to recognise or accept this</p>
                            <p>Drinkers who are extremely dependent on alcohol are frequently
                                able to tolerate drinking at levels that would be harmful for some
                                individuals or even kill some people.</p>
                            <p>When a dependent drinker abruptly cuts back or stops drinking,
                                they frequently experience physical and emotional withdrawal
                                symptoms, such as</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sweating</li>
                                    <li> Hallucination (Seeing objects or things that are unreal)</li>
                                    <li>Hand tremors â€“ "the shakes"</li>
                                    <li> Depression</li>
                                    <li> Anxiety</li>
                                    <li> Insomnia (Difficulty in sleeping) </li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>To prevent withdrawal symptoms, this frequently results in "relief
