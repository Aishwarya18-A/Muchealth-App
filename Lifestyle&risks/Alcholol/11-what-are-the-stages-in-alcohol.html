          <p>Alcohol abuse that progresses to a use problem happens over
            time</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Stage of risk:</b> This is when you drink for pleasure, to unwind,
                    or to cope with stress. You can begin to grow tolerant to
                    alcohol</li>
                <li><b>Alcohol use disorder in early stage:</b> At this stage, you've
                    advanced to experiencing blackouts, drinking in private or
                    alone, and having frequent thoughts about alcohol</li>
                <li><b>Alcoholism in the middle stages:</b>Your drinking has gotten
                    out of hand and is causing issues in your day-to-day life
                    (work, family, financial, physical and mental health). Lab
                    testing and imaging can reveal organ damage</li>
                <li><b>End-stage alcoholism:</b> Drinking has replaced food, intimacy,
                    health, and happiness as the primary emphasis of your
                    existence. Despair, organ damage problems, and death are
                    all on the horizon</li>
