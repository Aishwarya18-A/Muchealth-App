            <p>Sodium plays a vital role in the body to function properly:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '-> ';">
                <li>It helps balance of fluids in your body</li>
                <li>It helps in the function of nerves and muscleâ€™s function</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The kidneys balance the amount of sodium in the body. When sodium is low, the kidneys store it in the body. When sodium is high, the kidneys release a small portion in the urine.</p>
            <p>When kidneys fail to eliminate enough sodium, it will start to builds up in the blood. When this happens, the excess sodium starts to attract and holds water causing your blood volume to increase. Therefore, the heart will then be required to work harder to pump blood, and thus increasing the pressure within your arteries. This condition will raise the risk of kidney, heart, and stroke disorders.</p>
            <p>A few people are more sensitive to the effects of sodium than are others. That means they are more likely to retain sodium more easily, which leads to fluid retention and increased blood pressure eventually.</p>
