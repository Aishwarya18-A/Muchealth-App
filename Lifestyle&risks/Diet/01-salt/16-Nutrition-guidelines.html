        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <p>You can maintain or achieve a healthy body weight by eating a diet rich in high-fibre, low-cholesterol, and low-sodium meals. Foods including fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains aid with digestion and glucose (sugar) level regulation. When possible, use foods without salt added or fresh ingredients. Low-sodium foods include fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish.</p>
            <p>The majority of frozen vegetables make excellent substitutes for fresh ones. Fruits that are frozen or canned are also suitable. Choose canned veggies without salt added when you go grocery shopping, or rinse canned vegetables first before cooking them to reduce sodium content.</p>
            <p>Try substituting healthier components for those in your family's favourite meals that are high in saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterol, and reduce the quantity of salt you use. All recipes aside from those that need for yeast can be made without salt. Add fresh herbs and aromatics like leeks, onions, celery, carrots, ginger, garlic, lemon, or peppercorns if you're concerned that the dish lacks flavour.</p>
