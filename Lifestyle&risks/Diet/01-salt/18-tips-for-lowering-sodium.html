          <h5>TIPS FOR LOWERING SODIUM IN YOUR DIET!</h5>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <ol>
                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>TRACK HOW MUCH SODIUM YOU CONSUME</li></b>
                    <p>You must first ascertain your daily sodium intake and identify the high-sodium items in your diet. Most people consume identical things every day, according to Zumpano.</p>
                    <p>You can make adjustments that meet your health goals if you are aware of how frequently you consume salty foods. You might discover, for instance, that the soup can you often consume for lunch contains half of your recommended daily intake of sodium. You might choose a dish with less salt, such a salad, or hunt for a soup with less sodium, which could cut your sodium intake in half and yet leave you satisfied.</p>
                    <p>According to Zumpano, even one small adjustment can substantially reduce your daily sodium intake. But given that the soup in the can is convenient, low in calories, and high in fibre, you might want to retain it. To prevent your salt consumption from getting too high, you can simply cut back for the remainder of the day.</p>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>REDUCE YOUR SALTY FOOD</li></b>
                    <p>Take a look at the meals you frequently consume. Some foods have extremely high salt levels. Try consuming them infrequently or opt for ones with little or no added salt. The main offenders are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chips and microwave popcorn.</li>
                            <li>Canned soups.</li>
                            <li>Condiments like soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.</li>
                            <li>Frozen meals.</li>
                            <li>Processed snack foods (trail mix, crackers, beef sticks).</li>
                            <li>Pickles and olives.</li>
                        </ul>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"> <li>MAKE YOUR OWN MEALS AT HOME</li></b>
                    <p>More than 70% of the sodium Americans eat comes from packaged food and restaurant food. It can be challenging to manage your salt intake if you frequently eat prepared foods or eat out. Prepare more meals at home to reduce your salt intake. You can control how much salt is added to your food in this way.</p>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>CUT YOUR SALT INTAKE BY HALF</li></b>
                    <p>Eat largely home-cooked meals already? If so, you might think about progressively lowering the salt you use in recipes to control your daily sodium intake. Start by adding only half of what you usually would. Once you're accustomed to that, reduce it to 1/4 of the recipe's recommended amount.</p>
                    <p>According to Zumpano, using this strategy to cut back on salt enables you to gradually become used to a less salty flavour. "Because quitting cold turkey might occasionally be challenging. Food may taste bland as a result.</p>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>ADD FLAVOUR TO YOUR MEAL USING OTHER SEASONINGS</li></b>   
                    <p>You won't need the saltshaker if you utilise tasty items, so step away from it. To improve the flavour, think about incorporating herbs and spice that is either salt-free or low-salt. Basil, oregano, parsley, rosemary, turmeric, ginger, and powerfully flavoured veggies like garlic and onions will give your food a kick. Zumpano adds that if you enjoy spice, it's a terrific way to spice up dishes. Use fresh, dried, or salt-free canned cayenne, jalapeño, or green chilli peppers.</p>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>LEARN TO MAKE “SPECIAL REQUESTS” ABOUT YOUR MEAL AT RESTAURANTS</li></b>
                    <p>By making particular requests, you can reduce the amount of sodium in your meals when you eat out. You can request:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No salt to be added to your order during cooking.</li>
                            <li>Dressings and condiments on the side, so you can control how much goes on your food.</li>
                            <li>Fresh fruit, steamed veggies, a salad or baked potato instead of fries.</li>
                        </ul>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"> <li>CONSUME FOOD HIGH IN POTASSIUM</li></b>
                    <p>A mineral that functions in tandem with sodium is potassium. Potassium levels often fall when sodium levels rise.</p>
                    <p>Consuming extra potassium lowers blood pressure, which is the reverse of what sodium does. Increasing your intake of the mineral by consuming meals high in potassium, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avocados.</li>
                            <li>Bananas</li>
                            <li>Mushrooms.</li>
                            <li>Oranges.</li>
                            <li>Potatoes.</li>
                            <li>Peas.</li>
                            <li>Spinach.</li>
                            <li>Tomatoes.</li>
