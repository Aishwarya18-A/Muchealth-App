                <b clas="d-block mb-2">UNDERSTANDING “LOW FAT” LABELS</b>
            <p>A product must contain at least 30% less fat than a comparable product in order to be labelled as lower fat, reduced fat, lite, or light. The lower fat alternative, however, can still be a high-fat food if the type of food in question is typically high in fat (17.5g or more of fat per 100g). For instance, a reduced-fat mayonnaise may contain 30% less fat than the regular form while still being very heavy in fat.</p>
            <p>Additionally, meals with less fat may not always have less calories. Sometimes sugar is used to substitute fat, and the food may have a similar amount of energy as the original. Always remember to read the nutrition label on the packet to confirm the amount of fat and calories. Limiting your intake of fat is just one part of maintaining a healthy diet.</p>

        <p>At the moment, trans fat is present in almost all fast food and fried items. Nowadays, certain restaurant chains fry their meals with non-hydrogenated or trans-fat free oils.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that very little fried food belongs in a heart-healthy diet. Look for items that say they are trans-fat-free on the label or ones that show liquid vegetable oils in the ingredient list rather than hydrogenated oils.</p>

        <p>Foods that are branded "trans-fat-free" must have a trans-fat content of no more than 0.5 grammes per serving. A trans fat-free margarine should list liquid vegetable oil or water as its first component. These margarines could still include a tiny quantity of hydrogenated oil per serving, nevertheless. Portion control is essential, though, as once you go above the serving size, the food is no longer trans fat-free.</p>
