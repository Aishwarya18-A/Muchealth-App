           <p><b>Spaghetti Bolognese:</b>Use a less-fattening mince, as it has less saturated fat. Browning the mince before adding other ingredients will allow the fat to drain down if you are not using lower-fat mince. Alternately, combine meat mince with a meatless substitute.</p>
           <p><b>Pizza:</b>Choose a lower-fat topping over extra cheese or cured meats like pepperoni, salami, and bacon. Examples include vegetables, chicken, tuna, and other seafood.</p>
           <p><b>Chips:</b>To lessen the amount of surface area exposed to fat, use thick, straight-cut chips rather than French fries or crinkle-cut ones. If you're preparing your own, one alternative to deep frying is to bake the chicken wings with the skins on with a little sunflower oil.</p>
           <p><b>Potatoes:</b>By chopping your roast potatoes into larger pieces than normal and adding only a little sunflower or olive oil, you may make them healthier.</p>
           <p><b>Mashed potato:</b>Use 1% fat milk or skim milk in place of full or semi-skimmed milk, and reduced-fat spread in place of butter.</p>
           <p><b>Chicken:</b>Pick thinner cuts, such chicken breast. Remove the skin before eating to lower the saturated fat level.</p>
           <p><b>Eggs:</b>Prepare eggs without using butter or oil. You can boil, poach, or dry-fry eggs.</p>
           <p><b>Pasta:</b>Try serving pasta with a tomato-based sauce. Comparatively speaking to a creamy or cheesy sauce, it has less saturated fat.</p>
           <p><b>Milk:</b>Use 1% fat milk in hot beverages and on cereal. The amount of saturated fat is about half that of semi-skimmed.</p>
           <p><b>Yoghurt:</b>Choose a yoghurt that is reduced in sugar and fat. The differences between several items can be substantial.</p>
