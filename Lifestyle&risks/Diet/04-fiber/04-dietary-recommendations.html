            <h5>DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIBRE</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <p>It is recommended for a balanced diet; we should raise our daily consumption of dietary fibre to 30g. We need to find ways to increase our consumption because the average adult only consumes 20g per day.</p>
            <p>Compared to older adolescents and adults, children don't need as much fibre in their diet, yet they still need more than they now receive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children ages 2 to 5 need around 15 g of fibre per day</li>
                    <li>Children ages 5 to 11 need about 20 g of fibre per day</li>
                    <li>Children ages 11 to 16 need about 25g of fibre per day</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Children between the ages of 11 and 18 receive 16g per day on average. To make sure they are getting enough fibre, encourage children to eat a
                variety of fruits, vegetables, and starchy foods, preferring whole-grain varieties and potatoes with the skins on if feasible.</p>
