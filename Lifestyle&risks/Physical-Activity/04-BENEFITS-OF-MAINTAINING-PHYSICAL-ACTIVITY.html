                One of the most crucial things you can do for your health is regular 
                exercise. Numerous studies have demonstrated the advantages of 
                regular exercise on your health. If you are currently inactive and 
                have decided to become more active, you will probably experience 
                the greatest improvements in your health. Even if a person already 
                engages in 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity most days, 
                there are still advantages to be had by increasing their physical 
                activity levels. Overall, persons who exercise at the recommended 
                levels can cut their chance of dying too soon by 20â€“30%. The 
                following are other health advantages:

                <p>
                    Being physically active on a regular basis greatly reduces your risk 
                    of getting coronary heart disease, such as angina or a heart attack. 
                    Those who are not physically active on a regular basis have an 
                    almost doubled risk of having a heart attack. If you currently have 
                    heart disease, regular exercise is frequently recommended as a 
                    vital method to keep your heart disease from worsening.

                <li> <b class="d-block mb-2">REDUCED RISK OF DEVELOPING A STROKE</b></li>
                <p>
                    Those who are physically active have a lower risk of developing a 
                    stroke. According to one study, women over the age of 45 who walk 
                    quickly (at least three miles per hour) or for more than two hours 
                    per week lower their risk of stroke by a third compared to those 
                    who are less active.

                <li> <b class="d-block mb-2">HELPS TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS</b></li>
                <p> 
                    Regular exercise has been found to increase levels of high-density 
                    lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Through extensive research on 
                    people with high levels of blood cholesterol and the prevalence of 
                    CHD, the relationship between cholesterol and CHD has been 
                    reasonably well established. A decreased risk of CHD is 
                    independently associated with rising levels of high-density
                    lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, it is well known that a 
                    sedentary lifestyle considerably increases the risk of CHD as well 
                    as the adverse elevation of blood fat and cholesterol levels; physical 
                    exercise is crucial in reducing these health concerns.

                <li> <b class="d-block mb-2"> HELPS TO REGULATE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE</b></li>
                <p>
                    A significant health issue is hypertension. An increased risk of 
                    developing coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, 
                    and renal failure is linked to elevated systolic and diastolic blood 
                    pressure levels. When blood pressure reaches 140/90 millimetres 
                    of mercury, the risk of having certain disorders increases by one 
                    (mmhg). In many circumstances, customers can manage high 
                    blood pressure by losing weight, cutting back on alcohol, and 
                    changing their diet to consume less salt. Due to a lack of data, the 
                    evidence indicating higher intensity exercise is more or less useful 
                    in controlling hypertension is currently contradictory. Regular 
                    aerobic exercise normally has little impact on a person's normal 
                    blood pressure, but it may guard against the rise in blood pressure 
                    that is frequently associated with ageing.

                <li> <b class="d-block mb-2"> REDUCE RISK OF DIABETES & METABOLIC SYNDROME</b></li>
                <p>
                    In comparison to inactive people, those who engage in regular 
                    physical activity have a lower risk of getting type 2 diabetes. 170 
                    million people worldwide are affected by diabetes, which has 
                    become endemic in scope. The body's insulin regulation 
                    mechanisms weakening is a health effect of physical inactivity. 
                    Elevated levels of insulin and blood sugar are defining 
                    characteristics that contribute to the onset of non-insulin dependent 
                    diabetes mellitus. When insulin function begins to fail, blood sugar 
                    levels rise, eventually leading to the establishment of "prediabetes" 
                    and subsequently type 2 diabetes. Obesity and inactivity are the 
                    main causes of the rising cause of diabetes in both children and 
                    adults. Regular aerobic exercise significantly improves glucose 
                    metabolism and insulin sensitivity, allowing the body's cells to 
                    transfer glucose into the cells of the liver, muscle, and adipose 
                    tissue more effectively.

                <p>
                    The chance of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, 
                    osteoarthritis, abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, 
                    coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, sleep apnoea, 
                    respiratory issues, and some malignancies is raised when a person 
                    is overweight or obese. The best strategy for weight loss is one that 
                    incorporates calorie restriction, resistance training, and devoted 
                    cardiovascular activity into a reliable behavioural-modification 
                    delivery package. Weight loss is most effective when 
                    cardiovascular exercise is raised to 200-300 minutes of 
                    moderate-intensity activity per week, spread out over 5-7 days.

                <li> <b class="d-block mb-2"> HELPS TO BUILD BONE & MUSCLE STRENGTH</b></li>
                <p>
                    According to research, engaging in aerobic, bone- and 
                    muscle-strengthening physical exercise on at least a moderately 
                    strenuous level can prevent the loss of bone density that comes 
                    with ageing. Progressive overload, as well as load variation and 
                    specificity, must be addressed in physical activities that promote 
                    bone formation. Evidence also points to the fact that age-related 
                    bone loss can be prevented by engaging in moderate 
                    weight-bearing exercise like brisk walking on a daily basis for a long 
                    time. Greater amounts of physical exercise and harder relative 
                    intensities of effort are more effective at boosting bone density. 
                    Your muscle mass and strength can be increased or maintained 
                    with the aid of muscle-strengthening exercises.

                <p>
                    Your risk of acquiring cancer can be decreased by engaging in 
                    regular exercise. It approximately halves your chances of having 
                    colon cancer in half. Additionally, breast cancer is less frequent in 
                    women who engage in regular physical activity. According to study 
                    conducted by the Seattle Cancer Research Centre, being 
                    overweight and inactive may contribute to 35% of cancer-related 
                    fatalities.

                <p>
                    Exercise is supposed to reduce stress, increase energy, and 
                    promote overall well-being and self-esteem. Additionally, it might 
                    improve your sleep and assist in reducing rage. However, do the 
                    activity during the day or early evening, rather than close bedtime.

                <p>
                    Regular exercise throughout life can help you stay mobile as you 
                    age. Being mobile is one of the factors that allows older people to 
                    remain independent and live at home alone. As previously stated, 
                    flexibility and balance exercises are important as you age to help 
                    reduce your risk of falling and being injured. If you are physically 
                    active on a regular basis, you are less likely to fall and be injured if 
                    you are over the age of 70.
