                        Your risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, and 
                        high cholesterol may all be impacted by stress. Exercise is an 
                        effective way to combat and overcome stress. Depending on 
                        your preferences, you can walk, climb stairs, jog, cycle, 
                        practise yoga, tai chi, garden, lift weights, or swim.
