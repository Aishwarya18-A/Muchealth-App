                Physical inactivity includes not only not engaging in physical 
                activity but also engaging in passive physical activities like:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Television watching</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li> Working at the computer</li>
                <li>Talking over the phone</li>
                <li> Driving a car</li>                   
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Sedentism is harmful to your health! You should try to limit your 
                physical inactivity to no more than two hours per day. If you can't 
                avoid it (for example, because of your job), you should at least try 
                to break up your sedentary activities with easy exercises like 
                sit-ups or stretching.
            </p>

            <b class="d-block mb-2">DON’T HAVE TIME TO EXERCISE?</b>
            <p>Here are some quick ideas to keep you moving despite your busy schedule.</p>
            <p>
                Increase your walking—You can take the stairs instead of the 
                elevator, park farther away at the mall and walk the additional 
                distance, or walk to a nearby store instead of taking the car. Your 
                heart health can improve if you walk for at least 30 minutes each 
                day!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do household chores</li>
                <li>If you're on the phone, stand up</li>
                <li> Garden work</li>
                <li>Walk the dog</li>
                <li>Squat or bend to look at items at floor level and stretch to reach items in high places</li>                   
            </ul>
