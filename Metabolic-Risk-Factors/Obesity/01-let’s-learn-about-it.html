             <p>Obesity is described as a person who is overweight with excessive body fat. The most ideal way to check your ideal healthy weight is via measuring the Body Mass Index level (BMI).</p>
            <p>Your reference range to check your BMI level</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>18.5 - 24.9: Ideal healthy weight</li>
                    <li>25 - 29.9: You are Overweight</li>
                    <li>30 - 39.9: You are Obese</li>
                    <li>≥40: You are severely Obese</li>
                </ol>
            
            <p>However please note that BMI is not used to diagnose obesity because there are some people with high BMI levels but are muscular with very low-fat levels. BMI is mainly used to give you an indication if you are currently having a healthy weight. For those who are overweight and require additional measurement for excess fat, measurement of the waist size can also be used.</p>
            <p>Waist size measurement can be used in:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is recommended not to consume more than 14 units of
                      alcohol per week on a consistent basis.</li>
                  <li>It is recommended not to consume more than 14 units of
                      alcohol per week on a consistent basis.</li>
                  <li>It's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days per week if
                      you're trying to cut back on your consumption of alcohol</li>
                  <li>The safest course of action is to abstain from alcohol entirely
                      when pregnant or attempting to get pregnant in order to
                      reduce the risks to your unborn child.</li>
                  </ul>
            <p>Men with a waist size of ≥ 94cm and women with a waist size of ≥ 80cm are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems. Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on the severity and complications related to obesity.</p>
