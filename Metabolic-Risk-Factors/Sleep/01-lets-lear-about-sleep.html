                <ul>
                    <li>It is recommended not to consume more than 14 units of
                        alcohol per week on a consistent basis.</li>
                    <li>It is recommended not to consume more than 14 units of
                        alcohol per week on a consistent basis.</li>
                    <li>It's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days per week if
                        you're trying to cut back on your consumption of alcohol</li>
                    <li>The safest course of action is to abstain from alcohol entirely
                        when pregnant or attempting to get pregnant in order to
                        reduce the risks to your unborn child.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Alcohol consumption that is regular or frequent occurs most days
                and weeks. Any amount of alcohol used on a regular basis raises
                your health risk.
