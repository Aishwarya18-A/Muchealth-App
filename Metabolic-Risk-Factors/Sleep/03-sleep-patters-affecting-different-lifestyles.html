                <p>The birth of a child has a significant impact on new parents' sleep patterns. According to studies, parents suffer from sleep deprivation, interrupted sleep, and fatigue during pregnancy and the months following the birth of their child. When the responsibilities as a new parent combined with the effects of lack of sleep, clumsiness, forgetfulness, disorientation, and others, are of particular concern. Co-sleeping, carrying the child, bathing, remembering medications, and maintaining a safe environment all become unsafe when under the influence of sleep deprivation. It is therefore extremely crucial that new parents find a way to ensure they are getting enough sleep, even if this may be difficult.</p>
                
                <li><b class="d-block mb-2">SHIFT WORKERS</b></li>
                <p>As previously stated, there is mounting evidence that disrupting our body clock over time increases the risk of breast, colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers, and such evidence has led WHO to classify night shift work as a probable carcinogen. Shift work has also been linked to increased weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Insomnia, unrefreshing sleep, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, irritability, and potentially depression are all symptoms of “shift work sleep disorder”. It is very common but underdiagnosing and undertreating the condition may lead to potential serious consequences for individuals socially, economically, and medically. Employers should care for their employees to ensure that they are not suffering from complications caused by shift work sleep disorder and that they have enough time to catch up on quality sleep even during busy working periods.</p>

                <li><b class="d-block mb-2">COMMUTERS</b></li>
                <p>Over the recent years, we have seen number of peoples wiling to travel longer distance to work. Longer travel time leads to many workers have less free time outside of work to devote to health-promoting activities such as physical activity, cooking healthy meals, and sleeping. According to the studies done, workers are most likely to compensate by reducing their time spent sleeping when faced with this problem. However, this may contribute to lower productivity at work and increased risk of lower mental and physical wellbeing.</p>

                <li><b class="d-block mb-2">TEENAGERS & ADOLECENT</b></li>
                <p>Adolescents experience biological changes as well as environmental and societal demands that affect their sleep. Teenagers are staying up later to socialise with their peers and engaging in behaviours that lead to poor sleep hygiene and not enough sleep. In 2006, the National Sleep Foundation conducted a nationwide sleep study and discovered that adolescents with more than four electronic devices in their rooms were significantly more likely to report insufficient sleep on weekdays and weekends than those with 0-3 devices. The study found that adolescents aged 14 to 18 are more likely than 11 to 14 year olds to watch television, use the internet, instant message, talk on the phone, and do homework in the hour before sleep. The use of electronic devices is a particularly relevant issue in adolescents because not only are students encouraged to stay up later, but they are also exposed to light in the late evening, which shifts the biological clock. Shorter sleep, more fragmented sleep and less deep sleep could be due to stress and increasing examination pressure.</p>

                <li><b class="d-block mb-2">THOSE WHO LIKE TO PARTY</b></li>
                <p>Late nights and weekend parties are frequently accompanied using alcohol and other drugs, which can have an impact on sleep quality the following week. University students have identified partying as a factor that interrupts with their sleep. Even a small amount of alcohol can disrupt a person's normal sleep cycle. By staying up late when partying, people tend to have sleep deficit which will not be able to compensate later in the week leaving them vulnerable to the negative impacts of sleep deprivation.</p>
