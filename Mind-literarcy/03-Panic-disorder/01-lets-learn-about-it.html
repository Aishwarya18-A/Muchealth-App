              <p>Panic disorder happens when you experience overwhelming fear when there is no specific cause or trigger. In between panic attacks, you may worry greatly about when and where the next one may happen. It can even keep you from leaving your home. Panic disorder is a common mental health problem. It often starts in the teens or early adulthood, but may also begin in childhood.</p>
              <p>Panic disorder may be an overreaction of the body's normal survival instincts and behaviors. In people with panic disorder, the body may be more sensitive to hormones that trigger excited feelings in the body. Panic disorder can be upsetting and disabling. An attack can last from a few minutes to an hour or sometimes longer.</p>
