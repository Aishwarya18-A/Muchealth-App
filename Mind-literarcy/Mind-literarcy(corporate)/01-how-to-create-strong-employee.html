            <p>Employees tend to remain with a company until some force causes them to leave. The reasons why people stay in their jobs are just as important as the reasons why they leave them. What is needed is strong employee inertia level – the high level of employee retention in a company – the “Stickiness”.</p>
            <p><b>Source: Harvard Business Review, July 1973</b></p>
            <p>The strong inertia level is created by prioritizing MENTAL & PHYSICAL wellbeing of employees which has ultimate effects on productivity and profitability.</p>
            <p>These two components do not work as a “Balance” but more as a dependable “Connection” that needs to be maintained to ensure EMPLOYEES STAY MOTIVATED, GOAL DRIVEN & PRODUCTIVE at work. When one of these two areas are compromised it will result in employees not giving their job their FULL ATTENTION, which results in them not doing their best at work affecting overall productivity & performance of the company.</p>
            <p>Employee wellness (Physical and Mental Well-being) as the foundation and with other factors such as healthy work life balance, career development and benefits & rewards creates a healthy “ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE”.</p>
