      <b class="d-block mb-2">Understanding Your Symptoms</b>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why do you frequently urinate?</b>
        <p>
          Excessive urination is termed Polyuria. This usually happens when your
          kidneys are unable to filter out the extra glucose within your blood.
          When this happens, the extra glucose which ends up in the urine will
          draw in more water (Osmotic effect) leading to more frequent
          urination. Adults naturally produce 1 to 2 litres of urine per day.
          Polyuria is defined as more than 3 litres per day.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why are you extremely thirsty?</b>
        <p>
          Excessive thirst is termed polydipsia which is usually a result of
          frequent urination (polyuria). Polyuria causes you to lose a lot of
          fluids and polydipsia is your body urge to replace the lost fluids by
          making you feel thirsty. Extreme thirst in polyuria is always
          persistent, no matter how often you replenish.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why do you always feel hungry?</b>
        <p>
          Excessive hunger is termed polyphagia. This usually happens in
          diabetes due to your body difficulty in turning glucose into energy.
          Lack of energy will make you feel hungry and in diabetes, eating more
          sugar will not alleviate the hunger as all the sugar taken in cannot
          be processed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why do you have blurry vision?</b>
        <p>
          The increased blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels by
          causing them to get swollen and start leaking. This results in blurry
          vision.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">
          Why do you feel extremely tired and fatigue?
        </b>
        <p>
          Fatigue can be a mental or physical tiredness that doesn’t improve with rest. This
          in particular is a difficult symptom to research, but a 2016 study concluded that
          people with type 2 diabetes may experience fatigue as a result of fluctuations
          between high and low glucose levels and low energy levels.

        <b class="d-block mb-2">
          Why are your wounds healing slowly?
        </b>
        <p>
          If you have type 2 diabetes, regular cuts and scratches can take longer to heal.
          Wounds on your feet are common and easy to overlook due to your reduced
          sensation to pain. In addition to this slow healing foot ulcers occur due to poor
          blood supply as well as damage to the nerves responsible for blood flow to the
          feet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why do you have tingling, numbness and pain over your hands and feet?</b>
        <p>
          High glucose can damage the blood vessels that supply nutrients to your nerves.
          When your nerves don’t receive enough oxygen and nutrients, they cannot function
          properly. This is called diabetic neuropathy and is most common in your extremities
          (Hands and Legs).
        </p>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">
          Why are your experiencing sudden weight loss?
        </b>
        <p>
          Your body’s resistance to insulin causes glucose (sugar) to build up in the
          bloodstream instead of being turned into energy. When energy levels are
          constantly depleted this causes your body to consume other energy sources, like
          muscle or fat tissue causing you to lose weight.

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why do you get Frequent Infections?</b>
        <p>
          Having poor blood circulation and more sugar in your blood and tissues is an
          energy source for infections to grow allowing them to spread faster and more
          frequently within you.
          <br />
          Some common infections to take note of include:
        <ul>
          <li>Infections in the ear, nose, and throat</li>
          <li>
            Frequent Kidney infections (Pyelonephritis)
          </li>
          <li>
            Infection over your feet (Ulceration due to slow healing wounds)
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Why are there darkened areas of skin at your armpits or neck?</b>
        <p>
          One of the common symptoms in diabetes appears as a skin condition called
          Acanthosis nigricans. This condition forms dark bands of skin in the body folds
          such as your armpits, neck, and groin that has a velvety texture.

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Symptoms Specific to Men?</b>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Men with diabetes have lower levels of testosterone, which a 2016 study
            which linked to a decreased sex drive</li>
          <li>
            A review of research published in 2017 found that more than half of men with
            diabetes are affected by Erectile Dysfunction
          </li>
          <li>
            Some men may experience retrograde ejaculation as a symptom of diabetes,
            according to research
          </li>
          <li>
            The lower testosterone levels observed in men with diabetes may also
            contribute to reduced muscle mass.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <b class="d-block mb-2">Symptoms Specific to Women</b>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Urinary Tract Infections are more common in women and are more common
            and severe in those with type 2 diabetes, according to a review of research
            published in 2015</li>
          <li>
            Elevated glucose levels allow yeast organisms to grow more easily, leading
            to a higher chance of infection.
          </li>
          <li>Type 2 diabetes does not specifically make it more difficult to conceive,
            but polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can. Developing PCOS has been
            linked to insulin resistance, and PCOS has been shown to increase the risk
            of type 2 diabetes, according to the CDC.</li>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Are there symptoms of Pre-Diabetes?</b>
        <p>
          Prediabetes is a health condition where your blood sugar is higher than it’s
          supposed to be, but it’s not high enough for a doctor to diagnose you with type 2
          diabetes. There are usually no symptoms of prediabetes, but there are steps you
          can take to help prevent developing it:
        <ul>
          <li>losing excess weight and maintaining a moderate weight</li>
          <li>exercising as often as possible</li>
          <li>adjusting your diet, focusing on nutrient-rich, balanced eating plan</li>
          <li>drinking water instead of low-nutrient beverages such sugary drinks</li>
