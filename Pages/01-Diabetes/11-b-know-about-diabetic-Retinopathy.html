              Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that occurs due to
              diabetes. It is the leading cause of blindness in adults and one
              of the main reasons for vision loss in adults. If you are
              diagnosed with diabetes, it is important to have a dilated eye
              exam yearly to look for any early signs of vision complications
              for early treatment.

                Happens when fluid moves in and out of the eye due to
                uncontrolled high sugar levels. This causes the lens to swell
                leading to blurry vision.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Prolonged levels of uncontrolled diabetes will lead to high
                blood sugar levels that damage small blood vessels over time.
                This damage can lead to complications to the retina of the eye
                which can result in blurry vision and eventually blindness.

                Anyone who already has a diabetes diagnosis should go for a
                routine eye examination at least once a year. Regular tests can
                detect any problems whilethey are still minor.

            <p>
              When blood vessels bleed into the main jelly that fills the
              eye,this is called vitreous haemorrhage. Severe cases this will
              lead to vision loss, as the blood in the vitreous blocks light
              from entering the eye. If the retina remains undamaged, bleeding
              in the vitreous can resolve itself. However, when diabetic
              retinopathy leads to a detached retina this will result in severe
              vision loss due to the scar tissue pulling the retina away from
              the eye causing blindness. A detached retina presents a
              significant risk of total vision loss if a person does not get
              treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The normal flow of fluid in the eye may become blocked as new
              blood vesselsformation. This blockage causes a build-up of
              pressure within the eye, increasing the risk of nerve damage and
              vision loss.
