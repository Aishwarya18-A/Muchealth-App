           <p>The older you get, the more likely for you to have elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force that the circulating blood exerts onto the artery walls as the heart pumps blood around your body. Therefore, as you age, your blood vessels become stiffer causing high blood pressure levels within you.</p>
           
           <p>This means that as you get older, it is important to get regularly monitoring of your blood pressure to identify early abnormalities and prevent complications.</p>
           <p>Having blood pressure that is too high or too low has many causes and could increase the likelihood of severe medical conditions and complications.</p>
