                    Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. CVD is usually due to build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries called atherosclerosis and an increased risk of blood clots within vessels. Complications of CVD is due to damaged arteries in vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes.

                    Valve disease: Problem with the valves of the heart (Hardening / Leaking) that allow back flow of blood with your heart valves

                    Coronary artery disease: Problem with the blood vessels of your heart leading to blockage of blood flow

                    Heart failure: Problem with heart pumping/relaxing functions 

                    Peripheral artery disease: Blockages / Narrowing over the blood vessels of your arms, legs or abdominal organs

                    Aortic disease: Problem with the large blood vessel that directs blood from your heart to your brain and the rest of your body

                 <br />
                 These are the common risks factors for heart diseases to occur:
                 <li>Smoking</li>
                 <li>Pre-Existing High Blood Pressure</li>
                 <li>High Cholesterol levels (High LDL levels and Low HDL levels)</li>
                 <li>Lack of Physical Activity</li>
                 <li>Obesity</li>
                 <br/>
                 If you a smoker, your risks of developing heart diseases are doubled according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
                 <br/>
                 If you are diagnosed with diabetes and have uncontrolled blood sugar levels, you will have a higher risk of developing conditions such as:
                Heart Attack</br>
                Stroke</br>
                 Therefore, it is important to control your sugar level to reduce your risk of developing the above-mentioned complications. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), it is said that those who have both high blood pressure and diabetes double their risk for cardiovascular disease.
