                    During your initial appointment (assuming you are stable without any complications) your doctor will usually perform a full physical examination and obtain a complete history of your condition. Questions will be asked regarding your lifestyle habits, health status and family history. In addition to that there will also be other tests and diagnostics used to help aid in the diagnosis of your condition.
                    <br/>
                    The tests used to diagnose underlying cardiovascular disease includes:
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">BLOOD TEST</b>
                    <li>Laboratory Blood Tests: Identify overall health status by monitoring cholesterol levels, kidney function and specific protein levels.</li> 
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">NON-INVASIVE TEST</b>
                    <li>Electrocardiogram (EKG): Helps in the quick diagnosis of heart attacks and detects any possible signs of ischemia.</li>
                    <li>Stress tests: Heart is strained using exercise to determine how it responds through EKGs and/or images.</li>
                    <li>Echocardiogram: Image of the heart and blood flow is detected using sound waves.</li>
                    <li>Carotid ultrasound: Ultrasound done to get a more detailed view of your carotid arteries</li>
                    <li>Holter monitor: A heart rate monitor to be worn for 24-48 hours to monitor an extended view of your heart’s activity.</li>
                    <li>Cardiac CT: Images of the heart and blood vessels are created using X-Rays.</li>
                    <li>Cardiac MRI: Images of the heart is created using magnetic radio waves</li>
                    
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">INVASIVE TEST</b>
                    Invasive tests are done when blood tests and non-invasive testing done are not conclusive. This may include:
                    <ul><li>
                        Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. A catheter is inserted into your heart through the groin and arteries. Once this catheter is in your heart, a dye is injected into the delicate arteries and capillaries surrounding the heart. The dye helps produce a highly detailed X-ray image to visualize any abnormalities in a more conclusive way.
