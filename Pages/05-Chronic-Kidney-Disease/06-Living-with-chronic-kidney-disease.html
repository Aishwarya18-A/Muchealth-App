            <p><b>LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IF YOU ARE LIVING WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</b></p>
            <p>As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor might recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, dietary recommendations might include the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><b>AVOID food with added SALT</b></li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li>Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses.</li></ul>
              <li><b>EAT Low Potassium food</b></li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li>High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure.</li></ul>
              <li><b>EAT lesser amounts of Protein</b></li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li>Your registered dietitian will estimate how many grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals.</li></ul>
