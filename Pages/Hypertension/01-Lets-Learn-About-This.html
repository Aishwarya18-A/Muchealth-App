                <ul class="rounded pl-3 bg-white">High blood pressure (hypertension) is a condition where there is continuous force against your vessel walls that will eventually lead to a series of health problems mainly starting with the heart.
                    <b class="d-block mb-2"></b>
                       Blood pressure is a measure of the amount of blood pumped by the heart with the amount of resistance to the flow of blood within the arteries. Blood that pumps through narrow or clogged arteries will result having higher blood pressure values. The readings are given in two different numbers.
                    <li>Top number (Above): This is the systolic pressure which is the pressure within your arteries when your heart beats. </li>
                    <li>Bottom number (Below): This is the diastolic pressure which pressure within your arteries in between each heart beat.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <ol class="rounded pl-3 bg-white">The two main types of Hypertension will include:

                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Primary (Essential) Hypertension</b>
                    This is high blood pressure that occurs with no identifiable cause of high blood pressure.
                    Primary hypertension will tend to gradually develop over many years.
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Secondary Hypertension</b>
                    This is high blood pressure that occurs due to an underlying cause which results in high blood pressure.
                     Unlike essential hypertension, this type of hypertension appears more sudden rather then gradually. 
                     Examples of conditions or medications that can lead to secondary hypertension, includes:
                
                        <li>Chronic Kidney Diseases </li>
                        <li>Thyroid Diseases </li>
                        <li>Certain medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs </li>
                        <li>Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines</li>
