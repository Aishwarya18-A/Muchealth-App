                    Blood pressure measurements fall into several categories:
                    
                        <li>Normal blood pressure: < 120/80 mm Hg.</li>
                        <li>Pre-Hypertension: Systolic pressure ranging from 120 - 129 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure below < 80 mm Hg. This stage is also called elevated blood pressure.</li>
                        <li>Stage 1 hypertension: Systolic pressure ranging from 130 - 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 - 89 mm Hg.</li>
                        <li>Stage 2 hypertension (Severe): Systolic pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg </li>
                        <li> Hypertensive crisis. A blood pressure measurement of ≥ 180/120 mm Hg is an emergency situation that requires urgent medical care. If you get this result when you take your blood pressure at home, wait five minutes and retest. If your blood pressure is still this high, contact your doctor immediately. If you also have chest pain, vision problems, numbness or weakness, breathing difficulty, or any other signs and symptoms of a stroke or heart attack, call 911 or seek medical care IMMEDIATELY.</li>

                     You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
                    
                        <li> At any private / government clinic</li>
                        <li>At some pharmacies</li>
                        <li>At Home (By purchasing your own self-monitoring BP machine)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <b class="d-block mb-2">HOME-SELF MONITORING of Your Blood Pressure:</b>
                   
                        <li> Measure BP levels for a minimum of 3 days (ideally 7 days)</li>
                        <li> Measure BP levels at about the same time once in the morning (before drug intake if on treatment) and evening (before meal)</li>
                        <li> At least two readings should be taken at each occasion (at least 1 minute apart) for better accuracy of reading</li>
                        <li>Once the readings are obtained, please record the readings in a specific logbook or store it in your smart device for future reference</li>
                        <li> Make sure to get a BP cuff that fits. Bring the monitor with you to your doctor's office to check its accuracy once a year. Talk to your doctor about how to start checking your blood pressure at home. </li>
                        <li> Home blood pressure monitors are widely available and inexpensive, and you don't need a doctor’s prescription to buy one.</li>
                        <li> Home monitoring is an important way to check if your blood pressure treatment is working or if it is worsening</li>
                        <li>Devices that measure your blood pressure at your wrist or finger aren't recommended by the American Heart Association because they can provide less reliable results.
                        </li>

                    <b class="d-block mb-2">FURTHER TESTING TO RULE OUT OTHER CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION</b>
                     If you have high blood pressure levels, further tests are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and check for underlying conditions that can cause hypertension.
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Laboratory Blood & Urine Tests.</b>
                    Your doctor may recommend a urine test (urinalysis) and blood tests, including a cholesterol test to assess overall physical health status
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Ambulatory monitoring.</b>
                    This 24-hour blood pressure monitoring test is used to confirm if you have high blood pressure. The device used for this test measures your blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period and provides a more accurate picture of blood pressure changes over an average day and night
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</b>
                    Measures your heart's electrical activity.
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Echocardiogram:</b>
                    More detailed investigation for signs of underlying heart disease. Images of the heart are produced using sound waves.
