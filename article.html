                <p class="rounded p-3 bg-white">Diabetes is a condition that causes high levels of blood sugar (Glucose)
                    within the body. This sugar
                    (Glucose) is an important energy source for your cells. Too much of sugar in the blood can lead to
                    serious health issues. Glucose levels within the body is regulated by a hormone called insulin which
                    is regulated by the organ pancreas. Diabetes occurs when your body doesn't use insulin properly or
                    make enough insulin. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. There are no lifestyle
                    changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes. However, for type 2 diabetes you can
                    manage it through healthy eating and regular exercises.

                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Type 1</b>
                    This happens when your body's immune system destroys the insulin producing cells within the pancreas

                <p class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Type 2</b>
                    This happens when your body does not produce enough insulin or when your cells do not react to
                    insulin

                    <b class="d-block mb-2">Gestational Diabetes</b>
                    Diabetes that occurs mainly during pregnancy.
                    This happens due to high levels of sugar in the body during pregnancy
                    and not enough insulin levels to regulate it. This kind of diabetes if well
                    monitored and controlled will usually be reversible after pregnancy
