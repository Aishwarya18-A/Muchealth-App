                Salt, also known as sodium chloride, containing about 40% sodium and 60% chloride. It gives flavours to food and serves as a binder and stabilizer. It serves as food preservative, as bacteria cannot grow in the presence of a high amount of salt. A small amount of sodium is required by human body to conduct nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and maintain the proper ratio of water and minerals. It is estimated that we require about 500 mg of sodium daily for these vital functions.
