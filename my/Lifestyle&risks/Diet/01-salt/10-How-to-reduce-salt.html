          <h5>HOW TO REDUCE SALT IN YOUR DIET?</h5>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
           <ol>
             <li><b>Choose low-sodium products:</b></li>
                <p>When purchasing processed goods, look for those that are marked as low in salt. Purchase plain, whole-grain rice and pasta rather than items with flavours added.</p>
            <li><b>Eat more fresh foods</b></li>
                <p>The majority of fresh produce has a naturally low salt content. Additionally, fresh meat has less salt than ham, sausage, hot dogs, bacon, lunchmeat, and bacon products. Purchase fresh or frozen poultry or beef that hasn't had a sodium-containing solution injected into it. Check the label or inquire with your butcher.</p>
            <li><b>Remove salt from recipes whenever possible</b></li>
                <p>Many recipes, including casseroles, soups, stews, and other main dishes you prepare, can be made without salt. Look for cookbooks that emphasise reducing the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>
            <li><b>Eat at home</b></li>
                <p>Many meals and snacks from restaurants are heavy in salt. The daily limit for one entree may be reached or exceeded.</p>
            <li><b>Replace salt with herbs, spices and other flavourings</b></li>
                <p>To add flavour to your dishes, use fresh or dried herbs, spices, and citrus fruit juice and zest.</p>
            <li><b>Go easy on the condiments</b></li>
                <p>Sodium is an ingredient in soy sauce, salad dressings, sauces, dips, ketchup, mustard, and relish.</p>
            </ol>
                <p>Be sure to read the food labels at all times. The majority of packaged and processed foods have a <b>Nutrition Facts </b>label that includes the salt content of each serving. Additionally, it states whether salt or substances containing sodium are an ingredient. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baking soda (also called sodium bicarbonate)</li>
                <li>Baking powder</li>
                <li>Monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>
                <li>Sodium alginate</li>
                <li>Sodium citrate</li>
                <li>Sodium nitrite</li>
                <li>Disodium phosphate</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Try to stay away from items with 200 mg or more of salt per serving. Also, make sure you are aware of how many servings are contained in a container because the Nutrition Facts label includes that information.</p>
