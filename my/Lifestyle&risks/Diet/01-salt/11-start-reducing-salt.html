            <p>You might learn to enjoy less because your taste for salt is acquired. Your taste senses will adjust as you gradually reduce your salt intake. For assistance with the adjustment, think about using salt-free spices.</p>
            <p>You probably won't miss it after a few weeks of salt restriction, and some dishes might even taste overly salty. Start by limiting your daily salt intake to no more than 1/4 teaspoon, both when eating and when cooking. After that, discard the saltshaker. Youâ€™re craving for salt decreases as you use less of it, allowing you to appreciate the flavour of the food itself with its heart-healthy advantages.</p>
