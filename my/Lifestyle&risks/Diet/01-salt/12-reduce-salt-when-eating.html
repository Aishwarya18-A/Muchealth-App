           <p>Consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding flavour by using dried or fresh herbs like parsley, oregano, thyme, dill, or basil, or a dry herb combination.</li>
                    <li>Making use of flavour-enhancing ingredients like garlic and chilli.</li>
                    <li>Lemon or lime juice is a fantastic flavour enhancer and frequently helps meats become softer.</li>
                    <li>Use a recipe book to obtain ideas on what flavours go well together and experiment with small amounts. (For instance, eggs or potatoes taste better with curry powder, while vegetables pair well with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.)</li>
                    <li>Cutting back on salt is especially crucial if you already use a lot of it when cooking or eating. This is one simple step you may take to minimise your sodium intake because it makes up about 25% of the average person's overall salt intake.</li>
                    <li>Some people think sea salt is healthier than regular table salt, but since both include sodium chloride, it's recommended to stay away from both.</li>
                    <li>Steer clear of salt-heavy fast food and takeout.</li>
                    <li>When dining out, request less salt. You might even want to let restaurants know if their food seems too salty.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Consumers should check food labels and select low-sodium items since some manufacturers are reformulating recipes to lower the salt content of their goods.</p>
