            <p>Your doctor could advise you to limit your daily sodium intake to 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg. Take the salt shaker off the table if you want to start reducing your sodium intake because 1 teaspoon of table salt has 2,300 mg of sodium in it.</p>
            <p>Instead of ordering takeout, start cooking at home with fresh ingredients. When dining out, choose items that are simply cooked because foods that have undergone a lot of processing are more likely to be high in sodium. Instead of mashed potatoes, try searching for baked ones. Instead of vegetable soup, choose a side salad because commercial broths often include 800 mg of salt per cup.</p>
            <p>Additionally, keeping track of your daily salt intake may be helpful while you become used to the dietary adjustments. To make things simpler, you can either write it down or utilise a meal monitoring app.</p>
