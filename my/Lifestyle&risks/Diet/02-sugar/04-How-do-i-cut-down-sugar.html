                    <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
                        <li>Choose water, lower-fat milk, sugar-free, diet, or no-added-sugar drinks in place of sugary fizzy drinks or sugary squash. Whole and lower-fat milk both have the same amount of sugar, however choosing the latter lowers your intake of saturated fat.</li><br/>
                        <li>Even unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies include sugar, so keep your daily intake to 150ml or less.</li><br/>
                        <li>Try diluting no-added-sugar squash with sparkling water if you like fizzy drinks</li><br/>
                        <li>Reduce the quantity of sugar you add to cereal or hot beverages over time until you can completely stop using it. Alternately, use a sweetener instead.</li><br/>
                    </ul>

                <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN YOUR MEALS</li></b>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
                        <li>Try a lower-fat spread, reduced-sugar jam or fruit spread, sliced bananas, or lower-fat cream cheese on your bread as an alternative to spreading high-sugar jam, marmalade, syrup, chocolate spread, or honey</li><br/>
                        <li>Use nutrition labels to help you choose items with less added sugar, or choose the versions with fewer or less sugar.</li><br/>
                        <li>Consider cutting back on the sugar in your recipes. Except for jam, meringues, and ice cream, most things can be used with it.</li><br/>
                        <li>Opt for fruit juice-filled tins over syrup-filled ones.</li><br/>
                        <li>Select wholegrain breakfast cereals without added sugar that are not frosted or covered with chocolate or honey</li><br/>
                        <li>Opt for unsweetened cereal and experiment with adding some fruit for sweetness; this will help you meet your 5 days requirement. Berries, dried fruit, and banana slices are all tasty possibilities.</li><br/>
