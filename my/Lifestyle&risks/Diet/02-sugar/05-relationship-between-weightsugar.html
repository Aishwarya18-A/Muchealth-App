            <p>Consuming excessive amounts of sugar can help people consume excessive amounts of calories, which can result in weight gain. Your risk of developing health issues including heart disease, several malignancies, and type 2 diabetes rises if you are overweight.</p>
            <p>You should obtain the majority of our calories from other food types, such as starchy foods (wholegrain where available) and fruits and vegetables for a healthy, balanced diet, and only infrequently or never consume meals high in free sugars.</p>
            <p>For a healthy, balanced diet, the Eatwell Guide outlines how much of what we consume should come from each of the major food groups.</p>
