          <h5>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOOTH DECAY AND SUGAR</h5>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <p>One of the main causes of dental decay is sugar.</p>
            <p>Reduce your intake of free sugary foods and beverages, such as candy, chocolate, cakes, biscuits, sugary breakfast cereals, jams, honey, fruit smoothies, and dried fruit, and save them for mealtimes to prevent tooth decay. Because they are confined inside the structure, the naturally occurring sugars in fruits and vegetables are less likely to contribute to tooth decay. However, the sugars are released when fruit and vegetables are juiced or combined into a smoothie. When these sugars are released, teeth can be harmed.</p>
            <p>To lower your risk of tooth decay, keep your daily intake of fruit juice and smoothies to a maximum of 150ml (a small glass) and consume them with meals. Juice drinks, fizzy drinks, sweetened squashes, and soft drinks have no place in a child's everyday diet.</p>
            <p>If you are caring for youngsters, replace any sugary beverages with water, milk with less fat, or sugar-free options</p>
