            <p>Many breakfast cereals are high in sugar. Try converting to lower-sugar cereals or those with no added sugar, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>plain porridge</li>
                    <li>plain whole wheat cereal biscuits</li>
                    <li>plain shredded wholegrain pillows</li>
                </ul>
            <p>If you normally add sugar to your porridge, try adding a few chopped dried apricots or a sliced or mashed banana instead. Or you could try our apple-pie porridge recipe. If you add sugar to your cereal, you could try adding less. Or you could consume a smaller portion and add some chopped fruits, such as a pear or bananas.</p>
            <p>If you like toast for breakfast, try wholemeal bread, which is higher in fibre than white bread, and try to lessen your usual spreads like jam, marmalade, honey or chocolate, and opt for sugar-free or lower-sugar options.</p>
