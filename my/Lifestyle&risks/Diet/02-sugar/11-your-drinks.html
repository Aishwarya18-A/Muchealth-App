            <p>Almost a quarter of the added sugar in your diet comes from sugary drinks, such as fizzy drinks, sweetened juices, squashes, and cordials. If you take sugar in tea or coffee, gradually decrease the amount until you can cut it out altogether, or try swapping to sweeteners instead. Try some herbal teas or home-made tea with lemon or ginger.</p>
            <p>Like some fizzy drinks, fruit juice can be high in sugar. When juice is extracted from the whole fruit to make fruit juice, sugar is released, and this can damage your teeth. Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day</p>
