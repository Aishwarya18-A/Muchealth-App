        <h5>WHY DO WE NEED FAT IN OUR DIET?</h5>
            <p>A healthy, balanced diet should contain a small quantity of fat. Essential fatty acids, which the body cannot produce on its own, are found in fat. Fat aids in the body's absorption of vitamins A, D, and E. These vitamins are only absorbed with the aid of lipids because they are fat-soluble. Body fat is created from any fat that is not utilised by your body's cells or transformed into energy. Similarly, extra proteins and carbohydrates are also turned into body fat.</p>
            <p>Saturated or unsaturated fats both offer 9kcal (37kJ) of energy per grammes, compared to 4kcal (17kJ) for carbohydrates and protein.</p>
            <p>The 2 main type of fats found in food are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saturated fats</li>
                    <li>Un-saturated fats</li>
                </ul>
            <p>The majority of fats and oils contain both saturated and unsaturated fats, but in varying amounts. You should strive to eat fewer foods and beverages that are high in saturated fats and trans fats as part of a balanced diet and substitute some of them with unsaturated fats.</p>
