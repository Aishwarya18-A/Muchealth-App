            <h6>The majority of us need to increase our fibre intake and decrease our intake of added sugars. Consuming a lot of fibre is linked to a lower risk of colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.</h6>

        <h5>WHAT IS FIBRE?</h5>
            <p>Roughage, often known as dietary fibre, is an indigestible component of plants that helps them preserve their structural integrity. Because they are difficult to digest, fibres play a crucial role in both healthy colon and large intestine functioning. Dietary fibre is a term used to describe food components that do not fully digest or absorb before they reach the large intestine. The majority of fibre-rich foods can help you and add bulk to your diet, but some of the courser, rougher fibres might actually cause pain and exacerbate any existing problems.</p>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">THE TWO KINDS OF FIBRE</b>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: '-> ';">
                        <li><b>SOLUBLE FIBRE</b></li>
                            <p>Fruit, vegetables, and pulses all contain soluble fibre, which is often a soft, wet fibre that does not include the skin</p>
                        <li><b>IN-SOLUBLE FIBRE</b></li>  
                            <p>Mostly found in the outer layer of seeds, grains, fruits, and vegetables. It is the harder, less digestible fibre, and it can be stringy or coarse.Insoluble fibre is crucial to limit in several medical disorders. These include acute or subacute diverticulitis as well as the acute stages of other inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A low-fibre, low-residue diet may be used as a transition to a regular diet following various types of intestinal surgery. After a colostomy or ileostomy is performed, a low-fibre diet may be followed for a while.</p>
