          <h2>Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)</h2>
          
            <h5>About hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)</h5>
            <p>Hyperglycaemia is the medical term for a high blood sugar (glucose) level. It's a common problem for people with diabetes.</p>
            <p>It can affect people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes.</p>
            <p>It can occasionally affect people who don't have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack, or have a severe infection.</p>
            <p>Hyperglycaemia shouldn't be confused with hypoglycaemia, which is when a person's blood sugar level drops too low.</p>
            <p>This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes.</p>
          


          <h5>Is hyperglycaemia serious?</h5>
            <p>The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you're likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point.</p>
            <p>It's important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.</p>
            <p>Occasional mild episodes aren't usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods.</p>
            <p>Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes</li>
                <li>hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) – severe dehydration caused by the body trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels.</p>
            <p>If you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.</p>



          <h5>Symptoms of hyperglycaemia</h5>
            <p>Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.</p>
            <p>Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>increased thirst and a dry mouth</li>
                <li>needing to pee frequently</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>
                <li>blurred vision</li>
                <li>unintentional weight loss</li>
                <li>recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition.</p>




          <h5>What should my blood sugar level be?</h5>
            <p>When you're first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to.</p>
            <p>You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is.</p>
            <p>Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal</li>
                <li>if you're tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale)</li>
              </ul>
            

          <h5>What causes high blood sugar?</h5>
            <p>A variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>stress</li>
                <li>an illness, such as a cold</li>
                <li>eating too much, such as snacking between meals</li>
                <li>a lack of exercise</li>
                <li>dehydration</li>
                <li>missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose</li>
                <li>over-treating an episode of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)</li>
                <li>taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts.</p>



          <h5>Treating hyperglycaemia</h5>
            <p>If you've been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level.</p>
            <p>If you're not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team.</p>
            <p>You may be advised to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks</li>
                <li>drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you're dehydrated</li>
                <li>exercise more often – gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight</li>
                <li>if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this</li>
              </ul>
            <p>You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).</p>
            <p>Until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below).</p>


          <h5>When to get urgent medical attention</h5>
            <p>Contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>feeling or being sick</li>
                <li>abdominal (tummy) pain</li>
                <li>rapid, deep breathing</li>
                <li>signs of dehydration, such as a headache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat</li>
                <li>difficulty staying awake</li>
              </ul>
            <p>These symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital.</p>


          <h5>How to prevent hyperglycaemia</h5>
            <p>There are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Be careful what you eat – be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level.</li>
                <li>Stick to your treatment plan – remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team.</li>
                <li>Be as active as possible – getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you're taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much</li>
                <li>Take extra care when you're ill – your care team can provide you with some "sick day rules" that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness.</li>
                <li>Monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>When your blood sugar level gets too high — known as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose — the quickest way to reduce it is to take fast-acting insulin. Exercising is another fast, effective way to lower blood sugar.</p>
            <p>In some cases, you should go to the hospital instead of handling it at home.</p>
            <p>Very high blood sugar levels can result in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when insulin levels are low. This is a medical emergency.</p>
            <p>Symptoms of DKA include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>shortness of breath</li>
                <li>breath that smells fruity</li>
                <li>nausea and vomiting</li>
                <li>a very dry mouth</li>
              </ul>
            <p>If you aren’t sure what to do, call your doctor to get instructions on administering a dose of insulin, and for advice about whether to go to the emergency room.</p>
            <p>This article looks at ways to lower your blood sugar quickly, when to go to the emergency room or see a doctor, and tips for managing high blood sugar.</p>




          <h2>Best ways to lower blood sugar quickly</h2>
            <p>When treated early, you can bring high blood sugar levels down and prevent complications, including DKA.</p>
            <p>Some sources suggest that drinking water or eating a high protein snack can quickly lower your blood sugar levels, though there isn’t enough research to support this.</p>
            <p>If you have high blood sugar and need to lower it fast, try the following methods:</p>


          <h5>Take your insulin as prescribed</h5>
            <p>High blood sugar occurs when your body has too little insulin, or your body can’t use insulin properly. Administering insulin can bring your blood sugar levels down.</p>
            <p>Talk to your doctor about how much rapid-acting insulin you should administer when your blood sugar is high.</p>
            <p>You may want to check your blood sugar about 15–30 minutes after taking insulin to make sure your blood sugar is going down and that it’s not dropping too low.</p>



          <h5>Exercise</h5>
            <p>Exercise is a fast and effective way to lower your blood sugar levels.</p>
            <p>Exercise can lower your blood sugar for 24 hours or more after you’ve finished. This is because it makes your body more sensitive to insulin.</p>
            <p>Physical activity causes the body to demand glucose for energy. As a result, the cells deliver glucose to the muscles and blood sugar levels usually drop.</p>
            <p>For this to work, you need a form of exercise that gets your heart pumping faster than usual. This can include walking at a quick pace.</p>
            <p>Importantly, if your blood sugar is above 240 mg/dl, you should check your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, do not exercise, because this can make your blood sugar rise even higher.</p>
            <p>Exercising when you have ketones in your urine increases your risk of complications from high blood sugar.</p>
            <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor will likely recommend you check your blood sugar before exercising. You can do this with at-home urine ketone testing kits, which are available online.</p>
            <p>While exercise is an effective way to lower your blood sugar throughout the day, some types of exercises — particularly short bursts of strenuous activity — can briefly increase blood sugar levels.</p>
            <p>This is because strenuous activity activates the body’s stress response, causing a release of glucagon to power the muscles.</p>
            <p>If your ketone levels are high, avoid strenuous exercise and try some light exercise, like walking, instead.</p>

            
            <b style="color:red;" class="d-block mb-2" >SUMMARY</b>
            <p>Exercising can usually bring down high blood sugar levels, but don’t exercise if there are ketones in your urine. Talk to your doctor about whether you should take insulin to treat hyperglycemia.</p>



          <h2>When to go to the ER</h2>
            <p>High blood sugar can be very concerning because your body can start burning fat for energy instead of blood glucose.</p>
            <p>This can cause conditions such as DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). These conditions are medical emergencies and can be fatal if left untreated.</p>
            <p>DKA is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes. It’s rare in people with type 2 diabetes, but can occur.</p>
            <p>Symptoms that can indicate you should go to the emergency room include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>ketones in your urine, as diagnosed using a urine dipstick test</li>
                <li>confusion</li>
                <li>excessive thirst</li>
                <li>frequent urination</li>
                <li>nausea</li>
                <li>shortness of breath</li>
                <li>stomach pain</li>
                <li>vomiting</li>
              </ul>
            <p>High blood sugar levels can cause a fluid imbalance in the body and can cause the blood to become acidic in a manner that doesn’t support life.</p>
            <p>Medical treatments for these conditions include administering intravenous insulin on a continuous basis and IV fluids to correct dehydration.</p>
            
            <b style="color:red;" class="d-block mb-2" >SUMMARY</b>
            <p>High blood sugar can become a medical emergency. Go to the ER if you suspect DKA or HHS.</p>
          


          <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
            <p>According to the University of Michigan, blood sugar levels of 300 mg/dL or more can be dangerous. They recommend calling a doctor if you have two readings in a row of 300 or more.</p>
            <p>Call your doctor if you’re worried about any symptoms of high blood sugar. They can offer advice and reassurance.</p>
            <p>See your doctor if you have consistently high blood sugar levels. Symptoms of this include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>consistently high blood sugar readings</li>
                <li>frequent urination</li>
                <li>increased thirst</li>
                <li>high levels of sugar in urine</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Ask your doctor how often to check your blood sugar and about your ideal blood sugar levels.</p>  
            <p>If you don’t currently see a doctor who specializes in diabetes, known as an endocrinologist, you can find one by searching the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists’ website.</p>
            <p>You can find a certified diabetes educator by visiting the American Diabetes Association’s website and searching by zip code.</p>
            <b style="color:red;" class="d-block mb-2" >SUMMARY</b>
            <p>Talk to your doctor if you have consistently high blood sugar readings or symptoms of chronic hyperglycemia.</p>

                  <th>Blood sugar</th>
                  <th>What to know</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>70 mg/dL or lowerTrusted Source</td>
                  <td>Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Eat a snack to raise blood sugar (e.g. 1/2 cup fruit juice, 1 tbsp. honey, or 2 tbsp. raisins).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>80–130 mg/dL</td>
                  <td>Ideal preprandial range (before a meal).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>180 mg/dL or lower</td>
                  <td>Ideal postprandial range (1–2 hours after beginning a meal).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>240 mg/dL or higher</td>

          <h2>Tips for healthful living with diabetes</h2>
            <p>Most people can manage their diabetes in a way that stops their blood sugar levels from ever getting too high. The following tips can help:</p>
            <h5>Eat a consistent diet</h5>
            <p>Maintain a steady carbohydrate intake, avoiding “empty calorie” foods, such as processed foods, whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Foods high in dietary fiber help keep your blood sugar levels steady.</p>
            <p>For a balanced diet, eat plenty of the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>whole grains</li>
                <li>fruits</li>
                <li>vegetables</li>
                <li>lean proteins</li>

            <h5>Blood sugar levels are a primary concern for people with diabetes. High blood sugar, known as hyperglycemia, occurs when a person’s</h5>
            
            <h5>blood sugar is over 180 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</h5>
              <p>High blood sugar levels can be dangerous if not promptly managed and lead to both short-term and long-term problems.</p>
              <p>In this article, we look at some different ways to help people lower their blood sugar levels. These steps include lifestyle changes, diet tips, and natural remedies.</p>

          <h2>How to lower blood sugar levels</h2>
            <figure> 
              <img class="rounded w-100" src="/assets/img/article/HSP-02.jpg" alt="">
              <p>For those with diabetes, managing blood sugar levels can help to prevent serious complications.</p>
              <p>Here are 12 ways that a person with diabetes can lower high blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of complications.</p>
            </figure>

            <h5>1. Monitor blood sugar levels closely</h5>
              <p>High blood sugar levels often do not cause symptoms until they run well over 200 mg/dL. As such, it is essential for a person with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar several times a day. Doing so will mean that blood sugar levels never get that high.</p>
              <p>A person with diabetes can use a home glucose monitor to check blood sugar levels. These are available for purchase online.</p>          
              <p>Recommendations for how frequently to check glucose levels during the day will vary from person to person. A doctor can make the best recommendations regarding blood sugar monitoring to a person with diabetes.</p>

            <h5>2. Reduce carbohydrate intake</h5>
              <p>Researchers have carried out studies showing that eating a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet reduces blood sugar levels.</p>
              <p>The body breaks down carbohydrates into sugar that the body uses as energy. Some carbs are necessary in the diet. However, for people with diabetes, eating too many carbohydrates can cause blood sugar to spike too high.</p>
              <p>Reducing the amounts of carbohydrates a person eats reduces the amount a person’s blood sugar spikes.</p>


            <h5>3. Eat the right carbohydrates</h5>
              <p>The two main kinds of carbohydrates — simple and complex — affect blood sugar levels differently.</p>
              <p>Simple carbohydrates are mainly made up of one kind of sugar. They are found in foods, such as white bread, pasta, and candy. The body breaks these carbohydrates down into sugar very quickly, which causes blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.</p>
              <p>Complex carbohydrates are made up of three or more sugars that are linked together. Because the chemical makeup of these kinds of carbohydrates is complicated, it takes the body longer to break them down.</p>
              <p>As a result, sugar is released into the body more gradually, meaning that blood sugar levels do not rapidly rise after eating them. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole grain oats and sweet potatoes.</p>


            <h5>4. Choose low glycemic index foods</h5>
              <p>The glycemic index measures and ranks various foods by how much they cause blood sugar levels to rise. Research showsTrusted Source that following a low glycemic index diet decreases fasting blood sugar levels.</p>
              <p>Low glycemic index foods are those that score below 55 on the glycemic index. Examples of low glycemic foods include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>sweet potatoes</li>
                  <li>quinoa</li>
                  <li>legumes</li>
                  <li>low-fat milk</li>
                  <li>leafy greens</li>
                  <li>non-starchy vegetables</li>
                  <li>nuts and seeds</li>
                  <li>meats</li>
                  <li>fish</li>
                </ul>
            
            
            
            <h5>5. Increase dietary fiber intake</h5>
              <figure> 
                <img class="rounded w-100" src="/assets/img/article/HSP-03.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Eating plenty of soluble fiber, including whole grains such as brown rice, may help.</p>
              </figure>
              <p>Fiber plays a significant role in blood sugar management by slowing down the rate that carbohydrates break down, and the rate that the body absorbs the resulting sugars.</p>
              <p>The two types of fiber are soluble and insoluble fiber. Of the two types, soluble fiber is the most helpful in controlling blood sugar.</p>
              <p>Soluble fiber is in the following foods:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>vegetables</li>
                  <li>legumes</li>
                  <li>whole grains</li>
                  <li>fruit</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h5>6. Maintain a healthy weight</h5>
              <p>Losing weight helps control blood sugar levels. Being overweight is linked to increased incidents of diabetes and greater occurrences of insulin resistance.</p>
              <p>StudiesTrusted Source show that reducing weight by even only 7 percent can reduce the chances of developing diabetes by 58 percent.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that a person does not need to achieve ideal body weight to benefit from losing 10–20 pounds and keeping it off. Doing so will also improve cholesterol, reduce the risk of complications, and improve a person’s general sense of well-being.</p>
              <p>Eating a healthful diet full of fruits and vegetables and getting enough exercise can help a person lose weight or maintain their currently healthy weight.</p>


            <h5>7. Control portion size</h5>
              <p>At most meals, a person should follow portion guidelines provided by a doctor or nutritionist. Overeating at a sitting can cause a spike in blood sugar.</p>
              <p>Although simple carbohydrates are typically associated with elevated blood sugar levels, all food causes blood sugar levels to rise. Careful control of portions can keep blood sugar levels more controlled.</p>

            <h5>8. Exercise regularly</h5>
              <p>Exercise has many benefits for people with diabetes, including weight loss and increased insulin sensitivity.</p>
              <p>Insulin is a hormone that helps people break down sugar in the body. People with diabetes either do not make enough or any insulin in their body or are resistant to the insulin the body does produce.</p>
              <p>Exercise also helps to lower blood sugar levels by encouraging the body’s muscles to use sugar for energy.</p>

            <h5>9. Hydrate</h5>
              <p>Proper hydration is key to a healthful lifestyle. For people worried about lowering high blood sugar, it is crucial.</p>
              <p>Drinking enough water prevents dehydration and also helps the kidneys remove extra sugar from the body in the urine.</p>
              <p>Those looking to reduce blood sugar levels should reach for water and avoid all sugary drinks, such as fruit juice or soda, which may raise blood sugar levels instead.</p>
              <p>People with diabetes should reduce alcohol intake to the equivalent of one drink per day for women and two for men unless other restrictions apply.</p>

            <h5>10. Try herbal extracts</h5>
              <figure>

                <p>PinterestHerbal supplements, such as green tea, may help to boost the diet with essential nutrients..</p>
              </figure>
              <p>Herbal extracts may have a positive effect on treating and controlling blood sugar levels.</p>
              <p>Most people should attempt to gain nutrients from the foods they eat. However, supplements are often helpful for people who do not get enough of the nutrients from natural sources.</p>
              <p>Most doctors do not consider supplements as a treatment by themselves. A person should consult their doctor before taking any supplement, as they may interfere with any prescribed medications.</p>
              <p>Some supplements a person may want to try are available for purchase online, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>green tea</li>
                  <li>American ginseng</li>
                  <li>bitter melon</li>
                  <li>cinnamon</li>
                  <li>Aloe vera</li>
                  <li>fenugreek</li>
                  <li>chromium</li>
                </ul>

            <h5>11. Manage stress</h5>
              <p>Stress has a significant impact on blood sugar levels. The body gives off stress hormones when under tension, and these hormones raise blood sugar levels.</p>
              <p>ResearchTrusted Source shows that managing stress through meditation and exercise can also help to lower blood sugar levels.</p>

            <h5>12. Get enough sleep</h5>
              <p>Sleep helps a person reduce the amount of sugar in their blood. Getting adequate sleep each night is an excellent way to help keep blood sugar levels at a normal level.</p>
              <p>Blood sugar levels tend to surge in the early morning hours. In most people, insulin will tell the body what to do with the excess sugar, which keeps the blood sugar levels normal.</p>
              <p>Lack of sleep can have a similar effect to insulin resistance, meaning that a person’s blood sugar level could spike significantly from lack of sleep.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Why is managing blood sugar important?</h2>
              <p>Keeping blood sugars at target levels helps people with diabetes avoid serious complications from the disease. High blood sugar can cause many ill effects, which can be sudden, such as acid buildup in the bloodstream, or occur gradually over time.</p>
              <p>Over time, keeping blood sugar at unhealthful levels can damage small and large blood vessels in several organs and systems, leading to serious consequences, such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>vision impairment and blindness</li>
                    <li>foot ulcers, infections, and amputations</li>
                    <li>kidney failure and dialysis</li>
                    <li>heart attacks and strokes</li>
                    <li>peripheral vascular disease, a condition where blood flow to the limbs is reduced</li>
                    <li>damage to the nervous system, leading to pain and weakness</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>By keeping blood sugar levels under 100 mg/dL before eating and under 180 mg/dL after eating, people with diabetes can significantly reduce their risk of adverse effects from the disease.</p>
