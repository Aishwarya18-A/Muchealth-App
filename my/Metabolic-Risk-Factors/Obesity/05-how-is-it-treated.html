              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Avoiding Weight Regain</b></li>
                  <p>The more you lose weight the lesser calorie your body will need. Always ensure that once you have reached your ideal healthy weight, remember to stick to the diet and continue to follow the meal plans accordingly. Increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes / day will also help to maintain and prevent weight regain.</p>

              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Orlistat Medication</b></li>
                  <p style="color: red; font-size: .7rem;">Please remember to use this medication only if prescribed by your doctor. Orlistat is not usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
                  <p>Orlistat works by preventing around 1/3 of the fat from the food you eat to be absorbed. This undigested fat will not be absorbed and pass out in your poo. Please also note that this medication will help in avoiding you to gain weight (preventing fat absorption), but it will not help you lose the weight. Orlistat is best taken as an additional aid only when you have made significant effort to lose weight to diet and exercise.</p>
                  <p>Orlistat is only prescribed if you have either:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>(BMI) ≥ 28 and + other weight-related conditions (High blood pressure / Type 2 diabetes)</li>
                    <li>BMI ≥ 30</li>
                  </ol>
