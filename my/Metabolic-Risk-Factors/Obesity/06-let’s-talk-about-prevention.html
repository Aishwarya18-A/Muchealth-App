            <p>Please note that if your child has an underlying medical condition, please check with your doctor first to rule out any possible related health problems your child might be having.</p>
            <p>Here are some simple tips to follow in helping your child achieve his/her target ideal weight.</p>
            

            <ol>
              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Practice being a good role model to your kid</b></li>
              <p>Encourage your child to be active and eat healthy by showing them that you are also doing the same. Playing in the park or swimming with your children shows them being active is fun, and this is a great way for you to instil the importance of being physically active in a fun way.</p>              
            
              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Provide your kid with Healthy Child-size portions of food</b></li>
              <p>Try to avoid feeding your child oversized portions. Always go by the rule of letting your child ask for more if they are hungry rather then overfeeding them with food.</p>

              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Eat healthy meals</b></li>
              <p>Increase more fruits and vegetables and reduce the intake of processed or fast food when your children are hungry. Discourage your child from having sugary or high-fat foods like sweets, cakes, biscuits, sugary cereals, and sugar- sweetened soft and fizzy drinks. These foods and drinks tend to be high in calories and low in nutrients.</p>
              <p>It is important to teach your child the importance of getting most of their strength and energy from consuming healthier foods like fruits and vegetables rather then foods that are high in sugar and salt.</p>

              <li><b class="d-block mb-2">Less screen time and more sleep</b></li>
              <p>Avoid your kids from sitting / lying around too much, as this makes them more likely to put on weight due to constant physical inactivity. Try to limit the time they spend on inactive pastimes like watching TV, playing video games and spending long hours on electronic devices.</p>
