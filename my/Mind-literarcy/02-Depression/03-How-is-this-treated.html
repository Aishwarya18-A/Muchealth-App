        Before a diagnosis or treatment, your doctor should conduct a complete evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination of you. Other medical conditions that have symptoms that mimic depression should also be ruled.
       </p>
       <p>Treatment may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oral Medicine</li>
            <li>Counselling Sessions (cognitive behavioural therapy, or psychotherapy)</li>
            <li>Performing Relaxation techniques</li>
            <li>Coping Skills</li>
            <li>Making lifestyle changes to reduce stress and avoid stimulating substances.</li>
            <li>Seek help to quit smoking, drug or alcohol use if needed</li>
       </ul>
       <b class="d-block mb-2">Medication</b>
       <p>Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use yet full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If you feel little or no improvement after several weeks, your psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. Psychiatrists usually recommend that you continue to take medication for six or more months after the symptoms have improved.</p>
       <b class="d-block mb-2">Psychotherapy</b> 
       <p>Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant medications. Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships</p>
       <b class="d-block mb-2">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</b>
       <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns which includes strategies such as:</p>
       <ul>
            <li>Learning to recognize your distortions in thinking that are creating problems, and then to re-evaluate them in light of reality.</li>
            <li>Gaining a better understanding of your behaviour and motivation.</li>
            <li>Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.</li>
            <li>Learning to develop a greater sense of confidence in your own abilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <b class="d-block mb-2">Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</b>
        <p>ECT is a medical treatment that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe major depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.</p>
