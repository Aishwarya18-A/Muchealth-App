                <p>It is always important to recognize and identify why employees are not happy and tend to leave the organization prematurely. Listed below are some of the more common issues that can result in dissatisfaction amongst employees at the workplace leading to high turnover levels.</p>
            <ol>
            <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>ORGANIZATION WITH A MULTI-GENERATIONAL WORKFORCE</b></li>
                <p>Today's business environment may be the first to include five different generations working side by side toward shared economic and commercial goals. For business owners and executives, managing multiple generations in the workplace is NOT AN EASY TASK. Often situations due to CONTANT CHANGES & DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE EXPECTATIONS → employees from different generations will find it difficult to adapt to the organizational structure leading to lesser employee engagement and motivation levels. This will eventually lead to decreased job satisfaction levels and high staff turnover rates within the company</p>
                <p>Generations should work together to maximize mobility and growth which helps to create a steady internal talent pipeline which eventually increase organization retention rates.</p>

                <p>81% of Gen Z in Malaysia (aged 18-24) were planning to change jobs within the year, followed by 68% of Millennials (aged 25-34)</p>

            <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES WITH DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS</b></li>
                <p>As humans, we have a set of lived experiences, interactions, and events that help shape who we are. An individual’s age is a predictor of differences in attitudes in behaviours towards the environment. Researchers have studied how these formative experiences influence people’s views and expectations of the world</p>
                    <h6><b>(Source: According to the Pew Research Centre)</b></h6>
                <p>Each defined generation can have different prioritized needs, expectations, communication styles, and perspectives of their jobs. Business owners that are able to identify and implement management strategies via individual needs of each generation will help address the distinctive characteristics of different generations in the workplace will allow employers to harness the respective strengths of their workforce will lead to fewer misunderstandings, a more productive workforce and better employee retention levels.</p>
            <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>LACK OF COMMUNICATION & POOR LEADERSHIP</b></li>
                <p>Poor management and leadership can cause a wrecking ball effect into workplace conflicts. Amongst the issues faced is the lack of communication, no clear directions and presence of different levels of authority.</p>
            <b class="d-block mb-2"><li>CONFLICT OF IDEAS AND DIFFERENT OPINIONS</b></li>
                <p>Creative differences are no stranger to the workplace. However, there is the potential to turn the conflict of ideas into something new and different. Encourage the disagreeing employees to talk through their ideas with one another and try to find a common ground. Alternatively, you could employ a mentor to help sort the creative differences between the disagreeing employees.</p>
