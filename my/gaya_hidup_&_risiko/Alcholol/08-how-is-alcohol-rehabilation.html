            <p>After completely quitting drinking, some people are assessed as
                needing intensive rehabilitation and recovery support for a while.
                These individuals can receive this support by enrolling in a
                residential rehabilitation programme or participating in an intensive
                support programme in their local community</p>
            <p>Intense treatment is typically intended for persons with medium
                or high levels of alcohol dependence, as well as those who have
                seeked help previously and had unsuccessful treatment.</p>
