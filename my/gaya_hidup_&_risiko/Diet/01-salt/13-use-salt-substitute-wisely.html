            <p>A salt substitute is created by substituting potassium, magnesium, or another mineral for some or all of the sodium. You can use too much of the alternative and consume too much sodium in order to obtain that familiar salty sensation.</p>
            <p>For some persons, the potassium in some salt replacements may be problematic. For those with kidney issues or those who take medications, such as those prescribed to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, which promote potassium retention, too much potassium can be dangerous.</p>
