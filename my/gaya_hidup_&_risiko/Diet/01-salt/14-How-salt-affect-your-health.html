            <p>Foods contain sodium naturally because it is a mineral. However, it is also included in processed foods. While sodium aids in maintaining a healthy fluid balance in the body, persons who have heart failure should consume less sodium because it can help manage symptoms and help ward off further cardiac issues.</p>
            <p>A diet low in sodium can help minimise fluid retention, which means the heart doesn't have to work as hard. People with heart failure frequently have volume overload, which can overwork the heart. Your risk of stroke, renal disease, and heart disease, including heart failure, is increased by high blood pressure.</p>
            <p>A low-sodium diet can aid in better blood pressure management, which can lower your chance of certain disorders manifesting themselves or getting worse.</p>
