            <p>It is advised that free sugars, which include sugars that are naturally present in honey, syrups, unsweetened fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies, and pur√©es, should make up no more than 5% of the daily calories you consume from food and drink.</p>
            <p>This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adults shouldn't consume more than 30 grams of free sugar each day (roughly equivalent to 7 sugar cubes)</li>
                    <li>No more than 24g of free sugars should be consumed daily by children aged 7 to 10. (6 sugar cubes)</li>
                    <li>No more than 19g of free sugars should be consumed daily by children ages 4 to 6. (5 sugar cubes).</li>
                    <li>While there is no recommended upper limit for children under the age of 4, it is advised that they stay away from sugar-sweetened beverages and foods.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Try to LIMIT foods like desserts, cakes, cookies, chocolate, some fizzy drinks, and juice drinks all contain free sugars. We should try to limit these sweet foods. For instance, a can of cola may contain up to 9 sugar cubes, which is more than the adult daily allowance.</p>
            <p>Naturally occurring sugars can also be found in meals including fruit, vegetables, and milk; however, we do not need to limit these sources of sugar.</p>
            
            <p>Be aware that the "total sugars" number you'll see on food labels includes both of these and free sugars.</p>
