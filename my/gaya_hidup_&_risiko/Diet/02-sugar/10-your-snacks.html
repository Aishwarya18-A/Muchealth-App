            <p>Healthier snack options are those without added sugar, such as fruit (fresh, tinned or frozen), unsalted nuts, unsalted rice cakes, oatcakes, or homemade plain popcorn. You might be able to find something to do to divert your attention from food on some days of the week if you're a "all-or-nothing" type of person.</p>
            <p>Here are some lower-calorie substitutes for popular snacks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>cakes –</b>swap for a plain currant bun, fruit scone, or malt loaf. If you add toppings or spreads, use them sparingly or choose lower-fat and lower-sugar varieties.</li></br>
                    <li><b>cereal bars –</b>despite their healthy image, many cereal bars can be high in sugar and fat. Look out for bars that are lower in sugar, fat and salt.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>chocolate –</b>swap for a lower-calorie hot instant chocolate drink. You can also get chocolate with coffee and chocolate with malt varieties.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>biscuits –</b>swap for oatcakes, oat biscuits, or unsalted rice cakes, which also provide fibre.</li><br/>
                </ul>
            <p>Because it sticks to your teeth, dried fruit, such raisins, dates, and apricots, is high in sugar and potentially harmful to your dental health. Dried fruit should only be consumed as part of a meal, such as a dessert, in order to prevent tooth decay.</p>
