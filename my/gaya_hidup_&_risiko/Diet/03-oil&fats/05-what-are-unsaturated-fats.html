        <h5>WHAT ARE UN-SATURATED FATS?</h5>
       </div>
       <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
            <p>The greatest way to lower your risk of heart disease is to eat less fat overall and substitute unsaturated fats for saturated fats. There is strong evidence that switching certain saturated fats for unsaturated fats might help decrease cholesterol.</p>
            <p>Unsaturated fats can be divided into two types which are: either</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: '-> ';">
                    <li>Monounsaturated</li>
                    <li>Polyunsaturated (mostly found in fish and plant oils)</li>
                </ul>
                    <b>Monounsaturated Fats</b>
            <p>By maintaining levels of "good" HDL cholesterol and lowering levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol in your blood, monounsaturated fats support heart health.</p>
            <p>Monounsaturated fats are seen in:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: '-> ';">
                    <li>Olive oil, rapeseed oil and spreads made from these oils</li>
                    <li>Avocados</li>
                    <li>Nuts, such as almonds and peanuts</li>
                </ul>
                    <b>Polyunsaturated Fats</b>
            <p>Additionally, polyunsaturated fats can aid in lowering your blood's level of "bad" LDL cholesterol.</p>
            <p>Omega-3 and omega-6 are the two primary subtypes of polyunsaturated lipids. It is critical to consume small amounts of omega-3 and omega-6 fats since some of these compounds cannot be made by your body.</p>
            <p>Vegetable oils, such the following, contain omega-6 fats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mackerel</li>
                    <li>Corn</li>
                    <li>Sunflower</li>
                    <li>Salmon</li>
                    <li>Nuts</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Omega-3 fats are seen in oily fish, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trout</li>
                    <li>Sardines</li>
                </ul>
            <p>The majority of individuals consume enough amounts of omega-6; however, it is advised to increase your intake of omega-3 by eating at least two servings of fish each week, one of which should be an oily fish. Omega-3 fats from vegetables are not believed to provide the same heart-health advantages as those from fish. Learn more about vegetarian healthy eating.</p>
            <p><b>Remember:</b>Even though mono- and polyunsaturated fats are considered to as the "healthy" fats, you still need to watch how much of them you consume. Weight gain can result from consuming too much fat of any form.</p>
