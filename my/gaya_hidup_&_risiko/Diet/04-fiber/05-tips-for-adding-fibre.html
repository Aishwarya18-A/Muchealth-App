                <li>Try to choose most items from the list of soluble fibre</li>
                <li>If you enjoy eating foods with insoluble fibre, you may find that peeling the skin or removing the seeds and only eating the fruit or vegetable's pulp improves your taste for those items</li>
                <li>Some of the fibre becomes softer and more soluble when fruit and vegetables are cooked</li>
                <li>More soluble fibre can be found in ripe fruits and vegetables</li>
                <li>You should drink a lot of fluids because fibre can cause constipation if you don't consume enough of them. Try to consume 8 to 10 glasses of fluid each day.</li>
