            <p>No one food can give your body all the nutrients it needs. To meet your daily nutritional demands, you must eat a variety of meals in the proper quantities. However, eating a balanced, healthy diet should not be difficult.</p>
            <p>The Health Promotion Board created the simple-to-follow graphic guidance known as My Healthy Plate. It helps you develop better eating habits, which can help you control your weight and prevent chronic diseases.</p>

            <p>You may get an idea of what a more wholesome, balanced lunch would look like by following My Healthy Plate. The simple memory cue "Quarter, Quarter, Half" makes it simple to recall the proper ratios of each food category in a balanced meal. This is how:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place wholegrains on a quarter-sized plate.</li>
                    <li>Place a quarter of a plate's worth of protein-rich foods.</li>
                    <li>Place fruit and vegetables on half of the plate.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
      </main>
