                    <p>Because they have not undergone excessive processing and have retained their original shape, wholegrains are high in nutrients. White rice and white bread are examples of refined grains that have undergone processing that has resulted in the loss of important nutrients.</p>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">WHAT DO WHOLEGRAINS CONTAIN?</b>
                    <p>Phytochemicals, dietary fibre, iron, zinc, and magnesium are all found in abundance in wholegrains. They also contain vitamins B and E.</p>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF EATING WHOLEGRAINS?</b>
                    <p>Eating whole grains can help you manage your weight because they make you feel fuller for longer, which reduces the impulse to overeat. Consuming whole grains can also help you lower your long-term risk of contracting chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.</p>
