              Skin complications from uncontrolled sugar levels are usually the
              first visible sign of diabetes. Proper management of blood sugar
              levels is usually the best way to prevent and treat skin problems
              that are due to diabetes. High levels of blood sugar will cause
              you to urinate more leading to dehydration and dry skin.
