            <p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy also famously known as the broken heart syndrome, is a sudden Stress-Induced Heart condition. This is clearly not a heart attack however it mimics similar symptoms. Exact causes to this phenomenon remain unclear, but Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy does not indicate underlying heart disease.</p>

     <p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy starts as a sudden onset that is not predictable. This attack usually following a very stressful event, such as the death of a loved one, a natural disaster, or any kind of extreme physical stress. This syndrome causes the left side of the heart to bulge forming a balloon shape which is similar to the shape of a Japanese fisher’s takotsubo pot (for catching octopus). This gave the syndrome its name</p>
     <p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is said to represents about 1–2% of suspected cases with acute coronary syndrome, which is the term for a range of conditions linked with a sudden reduction in the blood flowing to the heart</p>
