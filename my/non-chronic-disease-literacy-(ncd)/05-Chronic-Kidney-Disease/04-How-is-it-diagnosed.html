            <p>The first step in diagnosing kidney disease is based on a few questions related to you:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Do you have any underlying conditions such as high blood pressure / diabetes /cardiovascular diseases/ Lupus/ Enlarged Prostate/ Kidney Stones/ Prolonged Kidney Infections?</li>
              <li>Are you on any long-term medication currently? (Lithium, NSAIDS, Omeprazole)</li>
              <li>Have you noticed any changes in urinary habits / amount?</li>
              <li>Do you have any family members who have CKD? who have kidney disease (CKD) can be diagnosed using laboratory blood and urine tests</li>
              <li>History of kidney stones in the past?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Second step is by using a series of laboratory investigations to determine underlying cause of CKD</p>
            <b class="d-block mb-2">Laboratory Blood test</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li>To measure the level of Creatinine and Urea within the blood (Waste products)</li>
            <li>To monitor the filtration rate of the kidneys, known as eGFR. Filter levels > 90ml/min shows a healthy functioning kidney. Levels below 90ml/min may show possible underlying CKD</li></ul>
            <b class="d-block mb-2">Your eGFR Reference Range</b>
            <p>This will help your doctor decide what treatment option is best needed and how often regular testing needs to be done to monitor the progress of your condition.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>stage 1 (G1) – a normal eGFR > 90ml/min, + other tests have detected signs of kidney damage</li>
              <li>stage 2 (G2) – a slightly reduced eGFR of 60 - 89ml/min + with other signs of kidney damage</li>
              <li>stage 3a (G3a) – an eGFR of 45 - 59ml/min</li>
              <li>stage 3b (G3b) – an eGFR of 30 - 44ml/min</li>
              <li>stage 4 (G4) – an eGFR of 15 - 29ml/min</li>
              <li>stage 5 (G5) – an eGFR < 15ml/min: kidneys have lost almost all of their function</li>
            </ul>
              
            <b class="d-block mb-2">Urine Test</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li>To measure the levels of albumin and creatinine in your urine (albumin: creatinine) ratio</li>
            <li>To check if there is any blood or protein in your urine</li></ul>
            <b class="d-block mb-2"> Other Additional Tests</b>
            <p>Used to assess the level of damage to your kidneys. These may include:</p> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';"><li> Ultrasound scan, MRI scan or CT scan : to check on overall condition of kidneys and if there are any defects or blockages seen</li>
            <li>Kidney Biopsy: Done by removing a small sample of kidney tissue to examine the cells under a microscope for signs of cell / tissue damage.</li> </ul>
