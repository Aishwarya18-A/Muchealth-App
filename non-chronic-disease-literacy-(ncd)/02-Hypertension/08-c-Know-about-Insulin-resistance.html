        <h5>What to know about Insulin Resistance?</h5>
      </div>
       <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
      <p>Insulin resistance remains a major feature of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance happens when cells in the body do not respond properly to the communication signals from insulin. This will increase the risk of developing prediabetes and, eventually, type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are pre-diabetic, your pancreas will work increasingly hard to release enough insulin to overcome your body’s resistance and keep blood sugar levels down. However, over time, the pancreas will gradually lose its ability to release insulin, leading to the development of type 2 diabetes.
    </p>
    <p>The following steps outline the current understanding of how insulin resistance develops:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Insulin loses its ability to support body cells effectively</li>
        <li>Pancreas secretes more insulin in order to maintain safe blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>In time, the pancreas becomes unable to maintain the release of extra
            insulin to compensate for the cells’ increasing resistance</li>
        <li>Consistently high levels of blood glucose develop, will lead to type 2 diabetes if an individual is unable to manage blood sugar levels</li>
    </ol>
