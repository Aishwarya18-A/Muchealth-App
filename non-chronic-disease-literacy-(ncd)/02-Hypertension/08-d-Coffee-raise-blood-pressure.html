            <p>Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor, which means that it decreases the size of blood vessels and can raise blood pressure. Caffeine exerts its effects by interacting with different receptors in the brain. Experts believe that other compounds in coffee, such as antioxidants, have a protective effect on blood vessels.</p>
            <p><b>PubMed Central 2017</b> concluded that people with high blood pressure should exercise some caution when drinking coffee but do not need to avoid it. The researchers found a 9% reduced risk when drinking 7 cups per day, with a 1% decrease in risk for each additional cup per day. The same review suggested that beneficial compounds in coffee, such as phenols, may have a protective effect.</p>
            <p>However, the benefits and risks of drinking coffee remain somewhat controversial, as the research to date is inconclusive.</p>
