            <p>Treatment of CKD will depend on the stage of your CKD. Treatment of CKD usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease.</p>
            <p>The main treatments are:</p>
        
            <ol>
              <li>Cultivate Healthy Lifestyle changes (Exercise & Healthy Diet)</li>
              <li>Good Boost to Immunity Levels (Vitamins and Healthy Supplements)</li>
              <li>Good Compliance to medication â€“ to control underlying conditions that may worsen kidney disease (high blood pressure/ diabetes/ high cholesterol)</li>
              <li>Dialysis: artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. A machine is used to filter waste and excess fluids from your blood.</li>
              <li>Kidney transplant: Done by surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Donor can be a living or deceased donor.</li>
            </ol>

            <b class="d-block mb-2">Treating CKD related complications:</b>
            <p>These are controlled to make you more comfortable.</p>
            <p><b>Stick to a Low Protein Diet:</b>To minimize waste products in your blood and to reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, it is recommended to eat less protein. Speak to a dietician to recommend a healthy diet plan for you that will suit your condition.</p>
            <p><b>To Relieve Swelling:</b>CKD can lead to retained fluids leading to leg swelling. Talk to your medical doctors if you can be prescribed with medication to relieve your leg swellings.</p>
            <p><b>To Treat Anemia:</b>CKD will lead to reduced hormone levels of erythropoietin that helps in the production of red blood cells. Supplements taken that help produce more red blood cells will help reduce symptoms of tiredness and lethargy due to anemia caused by CKD.</p>
            <p><b>To Lower Cholesterol levels:</b>People with CKD often have high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Speak to your doctor to start you on anti-cholesterols medication if needed to help lower cholesterol levels.</p>
            <p><b>To protect your Bones:</b>Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture.</p>
